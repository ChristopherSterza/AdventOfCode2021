# Advent of Code 2021
Advent of Code is a yearly advent calendar full of daily coding puzzles; one for each of the twenty-five days of Christmas.

In this repo, I will document the daily problems and post my solutions to them (time permitting).

The Advent of Code website for the 2021 calendar can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021).
